# MYP-reportcard-generator
This project is aimed at schools with the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program (IB MYP) that need to generate report cards but do not want to (or cannot) use proprietary solutions such as ManageBac.

The code provided works with Google Scripts and Google Sheets and allows MYP Coordinators to automatically generate report forms for all teachers to fill out once per semester. These forms are organized by teacher/subject, not by student, which makes it much easier for the teacher to complete.

Once the forms have been completed, the coordinator can with a single click have the data in the reports coallated and organized into individualized student reports, this time organized by student, not by teacher. This report can then be printed out and sent to students and their parents.
